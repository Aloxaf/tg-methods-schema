//! This file is written in [RON] (Rusty Object Notation).
//! 
//! This "schema" is a formalized version of the 
//! [telegram bot api documentation][tbadoc] which is not machine readable.
//! (note: this schema currently covers only API methods and **not** types).
//! 
//! Also, note that this file is **hand written** and may contain typos,
//! deviations from original doc, and other kinds of typical human errors.
//! If you found an error please open an issue (or make a PR) on [github].
//! 
//! This schema is targeting code generation for API wrappers in a statically 
//! typed language, though you may use it whatever you want.
//!
//! This scheme also has some intentional differences from original doc:
//! * New types:
//!   + `ChatId` - type of `chat_id` parameter, in the original documentation
//!     written as `Integer or String
//!   + `ChatAction` - type of `action` param in `sendChatAction` method
//!   + `AllowedUpdate` inner type of `allowed_updates` in `getUpdates` and
//!     `setWebhook` (so type is `ArrayOf(AllowedUpdate)`)
//!   + `ReplyMarkup` - type of `reply_markup` parameter, in the original
//!     documentation written as `InlineKeyboardMarkup or ReplyKeyboardMarkup or 
//!     ReplyKeyboardRemove or ForceReply`
//!   + `ParseMode` type of `parse_mode` params
//! * Integers represented with more strict (when possible) types, e.g.:
//!   `u8` (unsigned, 8-bit integer), `u32` (unsigned, 32-bit), 
//!   `i64` (signed, 64-bit), etc
//! * Instead of optional parameters `Option(Ty)` is used
//! * Instead of `InputFile or String` just `InputFile` is used (assuming that
//!   `InputFile` is a sum-type or something and it can contain `String`s)
//! * `f64` ~= `Float number`
